      <h1>Recipie 2</h1>

      <p>
        I created this recipe looking for a bread alternative not using any
        grains, processed sugar and processed oils. It is sitting between bread
        and cake feel and my wife loved it. I used pasture-raised eggs to my
        recipe, just because it is more nutritious. But regular eggs should be
        fine.

      <h1>Ingredients</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>6 Medium Eggs (or 5 Extra Large)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Coconut Oil</li>
        <li>Three-quarter cup Coconut Flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp Baking Powder</li>
        <li>Pinch of Salt</li>
        <li>
          Half tsp or less of Xanthan Gum (optional, to have a more stick bread)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Directions</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix all dry ingredients in a big bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the whole eggs and the coconut oil.</li>
        <li>
          Mix well with a spoon until it gets thick. You can add extra coconut
          flour if you feel it is too liquid.
        </li>
        <li>Pre-heat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).</li>
        <li>
          Pour the dough evenly into a Bread/Loaf form (coated with butter or
          parchment paper) and cook for 35 to 45 min.
        </li>
        <li>
          After cooking, remove it from the oven and let it sits while it cools
          down.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some variations can be done, like using butter instead of coconut oil
          or adding pumpkin pure to the mix and having a cake-like texture.
