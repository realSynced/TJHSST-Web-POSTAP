      <h1>Recipie 1: Kombucha</h1>
      <h3>By: Elias Pahls</h3>

      <hr />
      <p>
        The simple yet comprehensive guide to making tasty kombucha. This is
        intended to give you an initial overview of the process. I strongly
        encourage you to experiment with brewing times, teas, flavors, etc. The
        scoby is extremely tolerant, so the worst that can happen is that your
        resulting kombucha won’t be that great.
      </p>

      <h1>Ingredients</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>5l (1 gallon) jar</li>
        <li>3-5 tbsp black (or green) tea</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>kombucha scoby</li>
        <li>optional additional teas</li>
        <li>optional juices, fruits, spices</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Directions</h1>
      <p>Primary Brew:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Boil 1-2l of water.</li>
        <li>
          Rinse all the dishes you will be working with boiling water; this is
          important so the brew doesn’t go bad while fermenting.
        </li>
        <li>Steep 3-5 tbsp (or 5-6 bags) of tee in 3-5 cups of water.</li>
        <li>
          Strain the leaves from the tea and add 2 cups of sugar (or honey).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add other optional teas to your liking; I like to add a good handful
          of rosella tea; steep and strain this in boiling water separately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 4l of water to the tea concentrate and pour into a wide mouthed
          jar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the tea sit until it is less than 40°C; add ice cubes if it has to
          go quick.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add your scoby to the jar and seal the mouth tightly with a cloth or
          paper towel and a rubber band. The scoby has to breathe, but you want
          to prevent insects and dirt from getting into the jar.
        </li>
        <li>Let the jar sit in a warm dark spot for 10-14 days.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Second brew:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Taste the brew after 10-14 days; if it has started to carbonate and
          the sugar is mostly gone, it is ready. The brewing time will strongly
          depend on your personal preference, shorten or lengthen as you wish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once ready, strain 4/5 of the brew through a sieve into re-sealable
          glass bottles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make another batch of primary brew and refill the big jar; the
          remaining old brew will act as a starter. Rinse the jar and remove
          parts of the scoby once in a while.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you wish you can add juices, fruits, or spices to your brew. These
          will partially ferment and add a special character to your kombucha.
          One nice addition is apple and cinnamon mixed in with green tea.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the bottles sit in a warm dark spot for another 3-14 days; the
          carbonation process will continue, so make sure to release pressure
          from the bottles every other day.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you are satisfied with the carbonation and the flavor, put the
          bottles in the fridge. Here you can store them for weeks at a time.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy your kombucha, rinse, and repeat.</li>
      </ol>
