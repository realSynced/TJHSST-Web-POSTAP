    I just made a break
    <br />
    <br />
    I just made another break
    <br />
    <br />
    Let's take another break cause I am tired
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm probably going to get fired for taking so much breaks.
    <br />
    <br />
    Waittt.... But how <strong>strong</strong> am I?<br />
    I think I am <strong>strong </strong>enough.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Woahh!!!! That was a long break, but I would like to <em>emphasize</em> my
    <strong>strong</strong>ness.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm pretty strong you know...and that's why I need lots of breaks - to
    recover
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Alright. Now I think HR
    <hr />
    is going to be mad at me for taking so much breaks...When will this end?
