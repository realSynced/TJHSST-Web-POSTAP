        Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, and Attendants.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">DUNCAN.</span> Is execution done on
        Cawdor? Are not Those in commission yet return'd?
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold">MALCOLM.</span> My liege, They are not
        yet come back. But I have spoke With one that saw him die, who did
        report That very frankly he confess'd his treasons, Implored your
        Highness' pardon, and set forth A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
        Became him like the leaving it; he died As one that had been studied in
        his death, To throw away the dearest thing he owed As 'twere a careless
        trifle.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold">DUNCAN.</span> There's no art To find
        the mind's construction in the face: He was a gentleman on whom I built
        An absolute trust.
        <br />

        <br />
        O worthiest cousin! The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me.
        Thou art so far before, That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To
        overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved, That the proportion both
        of thanks and payment Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,
        More is thy due than more than all can pay.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold">MACBETH.</span> The service and the
        loyalty lowe, In doing it, pays itself. Your Highness' part Is to
        receive our duties, and our duties Are to your throne and state,
        children and servants, Which do but what they should, by doing
        everything Safe toward your love and honor.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold">DUNCAN.</span> Welcome hither. I have
        begun to plant thee, and will labor To make thee full of growing. Noble
        Banquo, That hast no less deserved, nor must be known No less to have
        done so; let me infold thee And hold thee to my heart.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold">BANQUO.</span> There if I grow, The
        harvest is your own.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold">DUNCAN.</span> My plenteous joys, Wanton
        in fullness, seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen,
        thanes, And you whose places are the nearest, know We will establish our
        estate upon Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter The Prince of
        Cumberland; which honor must Not unaccompanied invest him only, But
        signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine On all deservers. From hence
        to Inverness, And bind us further to you.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold">MACBETH.</span> The rest is labor, which
        is not used for you. I'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful The
        hearing of my wife with your approach; So humbly take my leave.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold">DUNCAN.</span> My worthy Cawdor!
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold">MACBETH.</span> [Aside.] The Prince of
        Cumberland! That is a step On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
        For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires; Let not light see my
        black and deep desires. The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be Which
        the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-style: italic">Exit.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold">DUNCAN.</span> True, worthy Banquo! He
        is full so valiant, And in his commendations I am fed; It is a banquet
        to me. Let's after him, Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome. It
        is a peerless kinsman.
        <br />
